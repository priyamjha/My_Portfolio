            <h1>Built a Python Slot Machine</h1>

            <p>This Python slot machine project is a simple simulation of a slot machine game where players can deposit money, place bets on multiple lines, and spin to win based on randomly generated symbols. The program calculates winnings based on a predefined set of symbol counts and their respective values, providing an interactive experience for users to play and track their balance.</p>
            
            <p>The slot machine project is a great example of a simple, interactive game with a clear structure, user input handling, randomization, and basic game logic. It allows for easy extension and further customization.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Deposit System: The program allows players to deposit money, ensuring that only positive values are accepted, providing a starting balance for the game.</li>
                <li>Betting and Lines: Players can choose the number of lines to bet on (up to a maximum of 3) and determine the bet amount for each line. The program checks that the total bet doesn't exceed the player's balance.</li>
                <li>Slot Machine Spin: The core of the game, where the slot machine's outcome is generated using random symbols. The machine consists of a 3x3 grid (3 rows and 3 columns), with each column containing a random assortment of predefined symbols.</li>
                <li>Winning Calculation: The project includes logic to check if the same symbol appears across all columns in a specific row (line), indicating a win. Winnings are calculated based on the symbol's value and the player's bet, with additional checks for multiple winning lines.</li>
                <li>Interactive Game Loop: The program provides a game loop that allows players to spin the slot machine as long as they have a balance and want to continue playing. It calculates the new balance after each spin and displays a summary of the results, including winning lines and total winnings.</li>
